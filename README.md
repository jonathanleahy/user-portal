# User Portal

J. Leahy - Thursday 20th Feb

We are creating a static web application that will eventually be user-facing and in a production
environment. This is a greenfield project, no code currently exists so feel free to make an
educated decision on which language/framework/libraries to use.

A user authentication service has recently been developed
(​ https://github.com/dantame/interview-authentication-service​ ) and this project will be the first to
integrate with it.

The user stories we have identified so far are:

1. As a user, I would like to be able to log in to the web application
2. As a user, I would like to view a personalised greeting when I log in so that I know I’m
logged in
3. As a user, I would like to be able to log out of the application

Rules

There are no rules to how you write your code and no trick questions! Treat this like you
would treat building any production-ready application from scratch. You may use any
programming language, libraries or framework you wish.
